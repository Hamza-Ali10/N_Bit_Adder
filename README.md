# N_Bit_Adder
The n-bit adder built from n one-bit full adders is know as a ripple carry adder, because of the way the carry is computed. Each full adder inputs a Cin, which is the Cout of the preceding adder. This kind of adder is called a ripple carry adder, since each carry bit "ripples" to the next full adder.
